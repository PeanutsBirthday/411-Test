order of operations

adding files and folders, not in .gitignore

	git add file.type

files need to be commited before they can be pushed, so commit changes 

	git commit file.type anotherFile.type -m "message about the commit"

pushing files to repo 

	git push -u origin main

view adds and rms that are not yet pushed 

	git status 

tips: 
dont commit your fucking ssh keys 
ssh keys need to be added to your profile to push from your computer 
view current setting for the user 

	git config --list
